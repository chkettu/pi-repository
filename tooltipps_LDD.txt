Detect columns
- If you want to correct a column pattern, set the "detectColumns" property to
true. If you want to correct a row pattern, set it to false.

Detect partial lines
- The partial line defect detection algorithm works by shifting a clone of the
target image and subtracting one from the other. This leaves short lines in the
image that indicate the origin of the defects. A too small value will confuse
these lines with residual noise in the processed image. Usually a value between
50 - 100 works fine.
You can separately configure the detection threshold of the partial line
defects with the partialLineDetectionThreshold property.

Image shift
- The partial line defect detection algorithm works by shifting a clone of the
target image and subtracting one from the other. This leaves short lines in the
image that indicate the origin of the defects. A too small value will confuse
these lines with residual noise in the processed image. Usually a value between
50 - 100 works fine.

Close former working images:
- When running the script multiple times on the active image, you can choose
to automatically close the working images from the last run by setting
the closeFormerWorkingImages property to true; only the target image
will remain open.


layers to remove:
- The algorithm isolates the small-scale structures from the large-scale
structures in the pattern and target images before finding the matching
scaling factor. This scale separation is enabled with the removeScales property.
This scale separation is defined by the layersToRemove property. This property
defines the scale size at wich we separate the small and large structures,
in a dyadic sequence. Thus, a value of 8 means that we will remove
the structures up to the scale of 2^(8-1) pixels (128).

rejection limit:
- After the scale separation, we also reject the bright pixels in the columns
or rows, mostly coming from the stars. This rejection is performed by
calculating the statistics of each column or row and defining a rejection limit
in sigmas with the rejectionLimit property. A lower value means a more
restrictive rejection.

detection threshold:
- The linear defect detection is driven by the detectionThreshold property. Its
value is in sigmas, so a lower value will detect more defects.

partial line detectioon threshold:
- You can separately configure the detection threshold of the partial line
defects with the partialLineDetectionThreshold property.
Its value is also in sigmas, so a lower value will detect more defects.

Output directory:
- The script writes a CosmeticCorrection-compatible defect table to disk. Please
specify the output directory in the outputDir field. Be careful not to add a slash "/" after the directory name. So Entering   C:/LDD is correct and
will write the defect column table in the directory C:/LDD/
