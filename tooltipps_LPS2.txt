Target is active image:
You can apply the script to the currently active image or to a set of images
inside a directory. In the first case, the targetIsActiveImage is used.
In the latter case, specify the data directory
in the Input/Output directory field.
inputDir and outputDir need to be the same if you specify a file name postfix.

Close former working images:
When running the script multiple times on the active image, you can choose
to automatically close the working images from the last run by checking
the Close former working images field; only the target image
will remain open.

Input/Output directory:
Directory for input files and output files.
If you process an entire directory, please change the image extension as well
in the "targetImageExtension" parameter and specify a filename postfix to avoid
overwriting the target images. Please don't write the point before the file
extension! Be aware that the file extension is case sensitive.

correct columns or rows:
If you want to correct a column pattern, check the "correctColumns" field. 
If you want to correct a row pattern, dont check it.

correct entire image:
You can correct all the columns or rows in the images, or you can correct only
specific ones. This is controlled by the correct entire image field. 
In case you dont check it, you'll need to specify a defect list file in the

Partial defects file path: 
This file should contain entire or partial rows or columns created by the script LinearDefectDetection.
Only these columns/rows will be corrected if you check the field correct entire image. But, if you check correct entire image, you'll still need to specify a defect file list to correct partial columns or rows, since the script will correct only entire ones until it finds a partial one in the defect list. 

Target image Extension and Postfix:
If you process an entire directory, please change the image extension as well
in the "Target image extension" field to "xisf" and specify a filename postfix "lps" to avoid overwriting the target images. Please don't write the point before the file extension! Be aware that the file extension is case sensitive.

Layers to remove:
The algorithm isolates the column or row structures from the large-scale
structures of the image. This scale separation is defined by the
"layersToRemove" field. The parameter defines the scale size at wich we
separate the small and large structures, in a dyadic sequence. Thus, the default
value of 8 means that we will remove the structures up to the scale of 2^(8-1)
pixels (128).If you select 9 the first 8 layers in the internal MulscaleMedianTransform process will be removed to the largescale structures.
means only the Residuals are left.


Global rejection
Function to perform a pixel rejection in the small-scale image based on the
pixel values of the target image. The rejected pixel values are set to 1
in the small-scale image; this way, they will be all rejected when performing
the in-line pixel rejection in the PatternSubtraction function since
the rejection high value will be always below 1

Rejection limit:
After the scale separation, we also reject the bright pixels in the columns
or rows, mostly coming from the stars. This rejection is performed by
calculating the statistics of each column or row and defining a rejection limit
in sigmas with the rejectionLimit property. A lower value means a more
restrictive rejection.

Background reference:
If the above normalization  or global rejection are activated, you need
to specify a background sky reference area by setting
the backgroundReferenceLeft, backgroundReferenceTop, backgroundReferenceWidth
 and backgroundReferenceHeight properties. The easier way to set these values
is to create a preview and check the numbers in PREVIEW > Modify Preview...
